     - administrativeAreaLevel3: Third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - administrativeAreaLevel4: Fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - administrativeAreaLevel5: Fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
     - colloquialArea:           Commonly-used alternative name for the entity.
     - locality:                 Incorporated city or town political entity.

     - neighborhood:             Named neighborhood
     - premise:                  Named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name
     - subpremise:               First-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name
     - postalCode:              Postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.
     - naturalFeature:           Prominent natural feature.
